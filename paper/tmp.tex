It is unfortunate that the survey exclude sampling points in area $g$ that districts gained. This precludes separation. Only predictions in Table \ref{T:Hyps}'s lines 1 and 4 are at odds, and both involve comparisons to land gained. The survey remains theoretically interesting to verify empirically total effects in lines 2, 3, and 5. 

My 2 cents: a dictator, in the Roman constitution, was meant to be a *temporary* one-man rule to confront a crisis. Autocrats perpetuate their rule. But often used interchangeably
