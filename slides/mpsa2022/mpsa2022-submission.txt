Title: Executive unilateral scheduling, the conclusive procedure, and legislative bottlenecks in Brazil's Camara dos Deputados

Abstract: Unlike presidents with mostly (or only) reactive formal powers in the legislative arena, Brazil's enjoys formidable proactive ones. Unilateral policy powers (medidas provisorias) have received scholarly attention. Much less is known about the urgency authority. A bill declared urgent confronts legislators with a short deadline to discuss and vote it, else it takes precedence in the voting schedule. Some have recognized that every medida provisoria gets urgent status upon publication. Others that committees have authority to pass legislation without a floor vote (apreciacao conclusiva). The paper brings these institutions together to explore how legislators, by relying on the conclusive procedure, can overcome scheduling bottlenecks set forth by abundant medidas provisorias.

Brief overview: 
How do legislators get access to Plenary time when busy executives have powers to deplete it? Brazilian presidents' frequent reliance on unilateral policy (Medidas Provisiorias) creates plenary bottlenecks. I study the Conclusive Procedure, another Brazilian institution with potential to free up plenary time for members' projects.
